# README

This Ruby-on-Rails-based website that displays some projects done over the course of my college career. This was created through Ruby on Rails, Heroku, Devise, HTML, Bootstrap, etc. Through this project, I learned how to write tests to check code coverage, set up a container through Docker, troubleshoot some issues on the Linux operating system, use a continuous integration pipeline through CircleCI, etc.

* Ruby Version: 3.0.2

* Built using Docker container

* Bootstrap, Devise, Simplecov, etc.
